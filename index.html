    <h2>6/25: A boring day.</h2>
    <p>Today consisted of me doing not a whole lot. However I got
        a bit more serious on my code learning. I'm implementing
        the <strong>Tomato Timer</strong> to help put my learning in breaks.
    </p>
    <p>I also had bacon today. It tasted quite good. I want to move
        to <strong><em>Europe</strong></em> but I'm not exactly sure where yet. We shall see
        I guess.
